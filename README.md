# Vowels To Notes
MuseScore 3.0 plugin to map vowels in lyrics to notes, according to
Guido of Arezzo's method.

This plugin maps the first six sequential notes in a selection to the
vowels a, e, i, o, u, and y. The seventh note, and to the end of the
selection, are mapped according to the vowels in the lyric.

## Usage
After installing the plugin in MuseScore 3.0, enter notes and lyrics as
normal.  In the measure before the lyrics, insert a new measure, and put in
six notes.  These notes will map to the vowels.  These notes can be in a
different time signature, span measures, etc. While the first six notes
in the example have lyric text, the text is actually ignored.

Next, select the six notes, along with the notes to be transposed.  So you
select from 'a' to 'back.'  Then run the plugin.

If you don't like how it came out, you can adjust the first six notes, and
then run the plugin again.

## License
While this is distributed under the Eclipse license, I honestly don't care.
